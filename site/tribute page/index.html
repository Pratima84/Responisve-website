                  records date back to the 2nd century.

                  the creator of Marvel's version of the God of
                  Thunder though, along with his brother Larry Leiber
                  and artist Jack Kirby. His first appearance was in 
                  "Journey into Mystery" #83 in 1962 and he went on to become one of the founding members of the Avengers.</p>

              <h3>Spider-Man is born</h3>
              <p>After creating other small super heroes, Stan decides to create a new kind of superhero. That was when Stan saw a fly crawling on the wall and thought of an insect superhero. He went down the list. Fly-Man, that didn't sound dramatic. Mosquito-Man, Nah, that sounded bad. He kept going until he got to Spider-Man. He LOVED that name! He ran into the publishers office and told him his grand idea. His publisher didn't like it and Stan decided to put it an old magazine to get it to go away.</p>
